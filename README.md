This app will allows a user to utilize a drawer menu in order to navigate to a currency exchange rate calculator, a language converter, and a GPS. On the currency exchange rate calculator the user will be able to set the currency that they are wanting to convert from, the currency that they are wanting to convert to, as well as the amount that they want to convert and the app will do the conversion for them. In the GPS portion of the app the user will be able to access their current location. In the language converter portion of the app the user will be able to select the language they are converting from, the language they are converting to, as well as a text box where they can input what it is that they want to be converted.
